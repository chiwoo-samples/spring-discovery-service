# Spring Cloud 
Making your code ‘cloud-native’ means dealing with 12-factor issues such as external configuration, statelessness, logging, and connecting to backing services.

## Service discovery
In the cloud, applications can’t always know the exact location of other services. A service registry, 
such as Netflix Eureka, or a sidecar solution, such as HashiCorp Consul, can help. 
Spring Cloud provides DiscoveryClient implementations for popular registries such as Eureka, Consul, Zookeeper, and even Kubernetes' built-in system. 
There’s also a Spring Cloud Load Balancer to help you distribute the load carefully among your service instances.
